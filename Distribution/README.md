# ContainerResizer by Vapok

Have you wished that you could change how much goes into a chest? Wish no longer!

With Container Resizer, you can independently adjust the storage size of each Chest.

When you adjust a storage size, it will sort and consolidate stacks automatically.

Contains Multiplayer support!

## Installation Note:
For Multiplayer Support, all players must have mod installed and running. Otherwise, they will see a standard size chest.
